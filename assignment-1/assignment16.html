                <h2>Who will cry when you die</h2>
                <p>On his deathbed, Aldous Huxley reflected on his entire life’s learning and then summed it up in seven
                    simple words: “Let us be kinder to one another.” All too often, we believe that in order to live a truly
                    fulfilling life we must achieve some great act or grand feat that will put us on the front covers of magazines
                    and newspapers. Nothing could be further from the truth. A meaningful life is made up of a series of daily
                    acts of decency and kindness, which, ironically, add up to something truly great over the course of a
                    lifetime.</p>

                <h2>Talk to your self</h2>
                <p>Years ago, when I was a litigation lawyer who had many of the material trappings of success yet little in the
                    way of inner peace, I read a book called As a Man Thinketh by James Allen. Te book discussed the enormous
                    power of the human mind to shape our reality and attract great happiness and prosperity into our lives. The
                    work also mentioned the profound influence of the words and language we use on a daily basis to create a more
                    enlightened pathway of thought.</p>

        <h2>Practice tough love</h2>
        <p>The golden thread of a highly successful and meaningful life is self – discipline. Discipline allows you to do
            all those things you know in your heart you should do but never feel like doing. Without self – discipline,
            you will not set clear goals, manage your time effectively, treat people well, persist through the tough times,
            care for your health or think positive thoughts.</p>
