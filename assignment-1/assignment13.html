    <p>There is a famous proverb stating, “Health is Wealth,” which is self-explanatory.<br> Health is an asset to human life, which leads to a stable and calm mind, ultimately leading to a wealthy life.<br> If a person is taking good care of their health, they get mental peace and can focus on their work further.<br> When we fall sick, it makes us irritated and unstable. Staying healthy is about being physically, mentally, and socially fit.<br>
